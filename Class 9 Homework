"The Game of Life" can have a rotary encoder added to replace the current spinner that it uses in place of dice. The spinner can be spun softer or harder to try to get it to land on a number. With a rotary encoder, you could have the players either turn it or press it. Once the input is received, it could output a random number between 1-10, which would be the number of spaces for the player to move. This way the number of moves is entirely random for everyone.
